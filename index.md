It's the third Thursday of November, and as every year, also a day to
celebrate our favourite spatial database.
From the [CARTO blog](http://blog.cartodb.com/happy-postgis-day/):

> Like [GIS Day](http://gisday.com/),
> [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) day
> is a grassroots effort open
> to everyone and is a wonderful opportunity to let people
> know about mapping, spatial operations, and discuss with
> friends the deep impact that maps, digital or otherwise,
> have had on our global culture and society.</p>
